# Tricky Bit


### Challenge Description:
Can you "debug" this challenge and find out the final value inside `rax` before the print happens? I'm not really sure how to do it

(Wrap the value you get in `bi0s{}`)
Example: If the value you get is `0xabcd1234` then your flag is: `bi0s{0xabcd1234}`

hint: Use gdb

### Difficulty: Medium
